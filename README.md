# Project-Task-Board

## Description


I was motivated to update the code for this Project Task Board as part of my bootcamp week5 challenge. This wesite was built to allow a user to track projects. I was able to make a responsive website that allows the user to track projects.

 Once the user has entered in all requested data into the form, the data is stored in local storage and then the user is able to view the project information rendered on the tracker

There is a feature on the tracker that allows you to drop and drag.
